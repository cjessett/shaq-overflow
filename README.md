Stack Overflow clone built in a couple of days at DBC, featuring:

- Answer favoriting
- User profiles

## MVP User Story
- Users should be able to post questions about Shaq. Other users should be able to answer them. Users should be able to respond to both questions and answers. Like StackOverflow, the responses should just be a flat list.

- The person who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers "the best."

- Users should be able to vote on Shaq-questions, Shaq-answers, and responses (both upvotes and downvotes) - only once.

- Users cannot add a Shaq-question, answer, or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.
